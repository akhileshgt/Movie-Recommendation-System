## Project Description
The dataset which I used is from [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). This version of the dataset consists of 1 million ratings from 6000 users on 4000 movies. Implemented a recommender system with text analytics in Python using Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative-Based Filtering algorithms. The model was developed on the dataset using features like movie titles, ratings, and genres. Analysed the text data, extracted features from text data using scikit-learn, created a recommender based on Cosine Similarity matrix which recommends movies based on the cosine similarity.
